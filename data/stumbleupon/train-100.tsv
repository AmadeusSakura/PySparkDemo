holographic calls, air-breathing batteries"",""body"":""A sign stands outside the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg Buildings stand at the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in the Santa Teresa Hills of San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg By 2015 your mobile phone will project a 3 D image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy At least that s what International Business Machines Corp sees in its crystal ball The predictions are part of an annual tradition for the Armonk New York based company which surveys its 3 000 researchers to find five ideas expected to take root in the next five years IBM the world s largest provider of computer services looks to Silicon Valley for input gleaning many ideas from its Almaden research center in San Jose California Holographic conversations projected from mobile phones lead this year s list The predictions also include air breathing batteries computer programs that can tell when and where traffic jams will take place environmental information generated by sensors in cars and phones and cities powered by the heat thrown off by computer servers These are all stretch goals and that s good said Paul Saffo managing director of foresight at the investment advisory firm Discern in San Francisco In an era when pessimism is the new black a little dose of technological optimism is not a bad thing For IBM it s not just idle speculation The company is one of the few big corporations investing in long range research projects and it counts on innovation to fuel growth Saffo said Not all of its predictions pan out though IBM was overly optimistic about the spread of speech technology for instance When the ideas do lead to products they can have broad implications for society as well as IBM s bottom line he said Research Spending They have continued to do research when all the other grand research organizations are gone said Saffo who is also a consulting associate professor at Stanford University IBM invested 5 8 billion in research and development last year 6 1 percent of revenue While that s down from about 10 percent in the early 1990s the company spends a bigger share on research than its computing rivals Hewlett Packard Co the top maker of personal computers spent 2 4 percent last year At Almaden scientists work on projects that don t always fit in with IBM s computer business The lab s research includes efforts to develop an electric car battery that runs 500 miles on one charge a filtration system for desalination and a program that shows changes in geographic data IBM rose 9 cents to 146 04 at 11 02 a m in New York Stock Exchange composite trading The stock had gained 11 percent this year before today Citizen Science The list is meant to give a window into the company s innovation engine said Josephine Cheng a vice president at IBM s Almaden lab All this demonstrates a real culture of innovation at IBM and willingness to devote itself to solving some of the world s biggest problems she said Many of the predictions are based on projects that IBM has in the works One of this year s ideas that sensors in cars wallets and personal devices will give scientists better data about the environment is an expansion of the company s citizen science initiative Earlier this year IBM teamed up with the California State Water Resources Control Board and the City of San Jose Environmental Services to help gather information about waterways Researchers from Almaden created an application that lets smartphone users snap photos of streams and creeks and report back on conditions The hope is that these casual observations will help local and state officials who don t have the resources to do the work themselves Traffic Predictors IBM also sees data helping shorten commutes in the next five years Computer programs will use algorithms and real time traffic information to predict which roads will have backups and how to avoid getting stuck Batteries may last 10 times longer in 2015 than today IBM says Rather than using the current lithium ion technology new models could rely on energy dense metals that only need to interact with the air to recharge Some electronic devices might ditch batteries altogether and use something similar to kinetic wristwatches which only need to be shaken to generate a charge The final prediction involves recycling the heat generated by computers and data centers Almost half of the power used by data centers is currently spent keeping the computers cool IBM scientists say it would be better to harness that heat to warm houses and offices In IBM s first list of predictions compiled at the end of 2006 researchers said instantaneous speech translation would become the norm That hasn t happened yet While some programs can quickly translate electronic documents and instant messages and other apps can perform limited speech translation there s nothing widely available that acts like the universal translator in Star Trek Second Life The company also predicted that online immersive environments such as Second Life would become more widespread While immersive video games are as popular as ever Second Life s growth has slowed Internet users are flocking instead to the more 2 D environments of Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc Meanwhile a 2007 prediction that mobile phones will act as a wallet ticket broker concierge bank and shopping assistant is coming true thanks to the explosion of smartphone applications Consumers can pay bills through their banking apps buy movie tickets and get instant feedback on potential purchases all with a few taps on their phones The nice thing about the list is that it provokes thought Saffo said If everything came true they wouldn t be doing their job To contact the reporter on this story Ryan Flinn in San Francisco at rflinn bloomberg net To contact the editor responsible for this story Tom Giles at tgiles5 bloomberg net by 2015, your mobile phone will project a 3-d image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy. at least that\u2019s what international business machines corp. sees in its crystal ball."",""url"":""bloomberg news 2010 12 23 ibm predicts

Spurs Throwback Jersey From 1967 to 1973 the Dallas Chaparrals were easily the most stunning pack of ballers in the ABA And then they moved to San Antonio long before the Spurs decided to pay

Barrette on an Ottawa Senators message board 7 Chicago White Sox Throwback Jersey Dick Allen s hipster glasses and epic stare hog this intense moment but we re still intrigued by the powder blue button down The Ambrose Burnside sideburns complete this masterful shot 6 Los Angeles Lakers Throwback Jersey The Minneapolis Lakers would only last 13 years 1947 1960 but they certainly cemented

"http://www.naffziger.net/blog/2008/07/05/the-alton-brown-flower-pot-smoker/"	"3294"	"{""title"":""The Alton Brown Flower Pot Smoker "",""body"":""Friends built the Alton Brown flower pot smoker a few months back and then visited this weekend and convinced me to build one for the Fourth Getting the parts While the actual construction of the smoker is trivial I found that gathering all of the needed items was challenging Many of the items were hard to source If you live in Seattle the guide below should help tremendously Generally speaking I would recommend that you try ordering everything but the Pot Bowl and bricks online Pot size selection The two hardest to source parts drive pot size selection The terra cotta bowl is hard to find The 17 bowl is the largest I was able to find anywhere It is also really heavy so it is impractical to order online However if you can find an 18 bowl I would be pretty tempted to get an 18 pot You can definitely fit the Weber 22 5 replacement charcoal grate in the pot it is actually about 17 or possibly even the 18 5 grill grate it is slightly less than 18 in actual diameter Not only would you get more cooking surface but you d also have a much easier to source grate Parts List ItemPriceSourceComments17 Terra Cotta Pot 19Home DepotThey had these at City Peoples but I didn t stop there until later 17 Terra Cotta Bowl 22City Peoples Garden StoreHard to find Try garden nursery stores I think it is also called an azalea bowl Some people use saucers that they drill into Heat Element 10Walgreens AmazonThere are reports of insufficiently sized heat elements This is a 1000W element that others have had success with The Maxi Matic ESB 300X is nearly identical to the Walgreens element I originally used The interior wires are a little shorter and thinner but otherwise the construction is nearly identical 16 Grill grate 20Sutter Hearth Home in BallardThe standard Weber sizes 14 18 and 22 are available everywhere Unfortunately they don t fit Order a 16 grate online well in advance I ended up using a more expensive grill topper Grill Thermometer 14Sutter Home HearthShockingly hard to find Try ordering online Pan for wood chips unkour kitchenShould be easy to find Get as heavy a pan as possible Ceramic Pot feet 6Stoneway HardwareThese are pretty easy to find elsewhere 3 Bricks 1 50Home DepotCould be 2 4s or anything else to get the smoker above the base 5 lb Pecan Wood Chunks 15Sutter Hearth HomePlan ahead and consider ordering online I later found Apple and Cherry chunks at Stoneway hardware for much less We used about 2 3 of the wood Getting the Heat Element controls out of the smoker I wanted to get the controls for the heat element outside of the smoker so that I could adjust the heat without opening the smoker This approach had the added advantage of getting the plastic base and overheat sensor out of the hot pot This was shockingly easy to do These instructions are for the Walgreens hot plate which seems to be pretty commonly used I m assuming that you re smart enough not to plug in the hot plate Remove the screw that connects the burner to the plastic base There is just one screw and its in the middle of the burner at the top Disconnect the wires from the heat element They are meant to be easily disconnected and reconnected All you need to do is press the tab and pull the wire and connector off of the pin Place some foil or preferably a non conductor over the exposed base to catch any drippings that may fall out of the pot we had none escape Keep the foil clear of the control element Center the hot plate base amongst the bricks see photo and run the wires up the hole in the bottom Reconnect them to the heat element I don t think it matters but the fat wire was originally connected to the prong that runs to the center of the heat element I used both bricks and the pot holder feet so that I could raise the smoker up off the base plate and allow air to flow up through the hole in the pot I then placed a brick in bottom of the smoker to support the heat element and keep the electrical prongs off the base of the pot I had to chip the corners of the brick so that it could sit to the side of the hole for air flow Obviously the wiring is much more exposed than it was in the sealed hot plate It is actually very hard to touch the wires during operation but be careful Also I d highly recommend you ensure that you re plugged into a GFCI protected outlet all outdoor outlets in buildings built after the mid eighties are required to be GFCI protected Temperature management and monitoring The temp at the top of the grill does a good job telling the temp inside the smoker We kept wireless temp probes in the meat throughout the process Metal smokers vs the Flower Pot vs the Big Green Egg You can buy a metal smoker from Wal mart or other sources for less than you ll spend assembling the flower pot smoker I ve never cooked with a metallic smoker but based on other comments I ve read the inexpensive ones are thin and shed heat tremendously quickly When we were finished smoking the internal temp was about 210 Two hours later it was 140 Four hours later it was still warm to the touch The Terra Cotta simply holds the heat really well The ambient air was in the sixties with a strong wind on our roof deck However the flower pot is no match for the Big Green Eggs These ceramic smokers are massive The equivalent size to the flower pot is probably the Large Egg which has an 18 diameter cooking area weighs 140 lbs and retails for 700 Plus I can t imagine I d have had as much fun as I did figuring the flower pot smoker out Recipe We cooked two 4 5lb Boston Butts on the 4th using Alton Brown s recipe for the brine and rub It turned out fantastically well Enjoy UpdateHamilton posted a series of really good questions alongside one of the photos and I wanted to include the questions and my responses here as I think they ll help other people I was wondering if you think it would be feasible to run a second Walgreen s burner through that bottom hole and into the pot This may give me the potential for more heat and heat control in the winter months when the weather is a little cooler here in South Carolina Maybe stagger them in the pot one above the other Or even side by side standing up I don t think you ll need to do this We had trouble keeping the heat down in the target 220 range and never had the dial anywhere near the halfway point By the end of the session I don t think the dial would go any lower Also these are 1000W burners 9 Amps Many household circuits are 15 Amps some are 20 so you d run the risk of blowing a fuse if you plugged them into the same circuit However if you did do it I don t think you d want to stagger them as the heat from the lower one may melt the solder on the higher one Side by side would work but you d need something else to set the grate on Also when you disconnect the burner from the base do you have enough length in the wire to connect the burner back to the burner once you ve run it through the hole with the original connections or do I need to buy some extension wires It is tight but there is enough wire If you do need to get wire make sure it is thermally insulated What was the highest temp you were able to see in your cooker We accidentally let it rise to around 240 220 is the target At some point I ll do a controlled test but it could definitely go much higher Do you soak your wood chips as well as leave water in the bottom of the pan When do you like to put the chips in the cooker When the cooker comes up to temp We used chunks instead of chips as they are less likely to actually catch fire I ve read that you don t need to soak them but a friend advised to soak half This way the dry ones start smoking early and the wet ones start smoking later So you don t need to lift the top until later in the cooking process lifting the top lets out the smoke and cools everything slightly Do you end up adding more chips to the pan throughout the cooking process If so what is your advice for removing the grill surface and the meat We added wood once and only opened the top twice The second time we lifted the top was to rotate the butts The meat can be easily removed using foil and oven mitts We had a plate with foil on the side to set them on If you look carefully at the picture of the butts you ll see two screws sticking up through the cooking surface We gripped the screws with oven mitts and lifted it directly out it did take a bit of effort as it was kind of jammed down there To remove the upper pot lid have you come up with a good handle or do you have an alternative method As your graph shows I guess it s a little hot and awkward to fooling around with when it s that hot It shockingly isn t too hot to touch The lid measurements are from the interior The exterior of the terra cotta is definitely cooler Some people claim that they can use their bare hands I just used oven mitts but used my hands to make minor adjustments Would it be beneficial to drill more holes in the bottom of the pot to let in more fresh air or do you think that would let too much heat out I don t think you want to do this You don t want the wood to burn heavy air flow you want it to combust enough to smoke We had absolutely no problems with air flow "",""url"":""naffziger

bacteria in teen acne battle"",""title"":""Doctors Strike Mutating Bacteria In Teen Acne Battle Shots doctors strike mutating bacteria in teen acne battle : npr"",""body"":""Charles Bowman University of Pittsburgh A tiny bacteriophage virus can cripple the bacteria that cause troublesome acne on teens skin Acne the scourge of many an adolescent life is getting harder to treat but 80 percent of teenagers have some form of it Conventional treatment includes topical and oral antibiotics Studies are now finding the bacteria that cause acne are increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment Alternatively there are effective laser treatments But these are costly and typically not covered by insurance Now researchers are scrambling to come up with new treatments for acne One promising possibility involves harnessing a harmless virus living on skin that naturally seeks out and kills the bacteria that cause pimples People Always Notice It s every teenager s nightmare big blistery red bumps on their faces That s what people notice first about you so no matter how great of a person you are no matter how pretty your eyes are how nice your smile is people always notice the blemishes on your face says Rohini Bagrodia a really pretty 22 year old with beautiful eyes a great smile and a history of battling acne In school it meant avoiding the spotlight I would always shy away from those opportunities that would bring all the focus on me Bagrodia says She wouldn t take part in class discussions She wouldn t raise her hand And it s all because of a tiny bacteria that lives on the skin UCLA dermatologist Dr Jenny Kim says many people don t realize it s bacteria that cause acne Some people say your face is dirty you need to clean it more scrub more don t eat chocolate things like that But really it s caused by bacteria and the oil inside the pore allows the bacteria to overpopulate Kim says For most teenagers with mild acne over the counter products containing peroxide or salicylic acid are enough to clear up the acne But lots of teenagers end up in the doctor s office and getting antibiotics This was the hardest thing for Bagrodia No matter how much she followed doctors orders diligently cleaning her face and using antibiotic cream nothing worked Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Dermatologist Elizabeth Martin is in private practice in Birmingham Ala and is a fellow with the American Academy of Dermatology She says these bacteria like many others are mutating quickly and becoming resistant to antibiotics Over the years we have seen an increase in this antibiotic resistant bacterium both in the U S and also worldwide Martin says She points to studies that show a tripling of drug resistant acne bacteria over the past few decades This means doctors can no longer rely on antibiotics alone Most doctors now use a combination of low dose antibiotics along with benzoyl peroxide which also kills acne causing bacteria As Martin says benzoyl peroxide works to decrease bacteria through a different mechanism than antibiotics and it helps to prevent development of resistant bacteria When we combine benzoyl peroxide along with an antibiotic patients tend to have better clearance of their acne than when we use antibiotics alone Other Treatment Options Retinoids vitamin A derivatives can also be used early on to treat acne Typically creams they work by unclogging pores before they become large inflamed bumps A stronger form called Accutane is used for severe acne It s a highly effective pill but it can cause serious side effects including depression and birth defects So the government regulates its use Intensely focused light and lasers can also help fight acne when other treatments fail Kim is also a researcher at UCLA In the room dedicated to light and laser therapy Kim points out what appears to be a half cylinder with stacks of oblong light bulbs Patients with acne can go right under blue light and they sit there for about 15 20 minutes and acne often improves after several treatments Kim says It s not known exactly how light therapy works to fight acne but Kim says studies indicate it destroys the bacteria Probably physically without giving it time to mutate and the other thing the light treatment can improve the inflammation that the bacteria causes in acne she says But laser and light therapy doesn t work for everyone It s expensive and typically not covered by insurance So Kim and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh are also looking into an entirely new way to fight acne taking a harmless virus that lives on the skin and programming it to become a bacteria killer The virus is going to go and kill the bacteria that causes acne It s just going to break it apart and burst its membrane so there s no time for the bacteria to mutate she says It s sort of a surprise attack The approach is a promising way to get rid of acne without using antibiotics If further lab studies prove successful researchers will begin testing on people to see if viral therapy is both safe and effective in fighting acne as acne bacteria develop resistance to antibiotic treatments, doctors turn to zit-fighting viruses. as acne bacteria develop resistance to antibiotic treatments, doctors turn to zit-fighting

of their money must be the sale of bottled water In the western world tap water is about as safe as it can be and it is relatively cheap Yet many people are prepared to pay up to 1 500 times as much when the same stuff comes in a bottle In this paper we will consider this phenomenon The bottled water boom was indeed an unlikely phenomenon Perhaps the strangest thing about it was that this bland commodity made its impact in Britain at the height of a recession and with raging inflation There was a general lack of money in people s pockets yet bottled water became an overnight success Strange too is the fact that present water companies boast of the purity of their product when the various impurities that mineral waters contain used to be the whole point of buying the stuff anyway Natural water is never purer than when it falls on the hills as rain Once it hits the ground however all that changes Seeping into the soil it moves underground through passages and caverns carved over the millennia eating away at the rock and dissolving metals salts and minerals along the way As it goes its character changes depending on the type of rock through which it passes Eventually it arrives in underground lakes or aquifers the sources of most bottled mineral waters Throw out the Bath water Since Roman times Bath Spa in Britain has been a centre renowned for its mineral springs and baths Little has changed since Roman times Bath spring waters have always had a reputation for health giving properties because of their natural origins But merely because they are natural and come from underground does not mean that they are safe to drink A study carried out by the University of Wales found elevated amounts of several elements regarded as poisonous in the water Bath s waters come up from some 22 miles below the surface On their way they absorb quantities of fluoride and sulphates well beyond the safety limits set for tap water It s the water which is good for you it is usually better to keep the minerals out The minerals can often do harm Over the past half century there has been a distinct shift of opinion Until the Second World War the waters of Bath were advertised and promoted on the amount of radioactivity they contained People believed that radioactivity was health promoting They don t believe that now and the radioactivity of Bath s spring water isn t mentioned today Travelling through the ground as it does Bath s water picks up more than minerals In 1979 a girl swimming in a pool dived down to where the source water was coming in and swallowed some of it Five days later she died of amoebic meningitis Tests showed that the amoeba was in the water and the pool was closed The fad in the bottle By the 1970s people had stopped taking the waters the fashion had faded and the days of health giving spring waters appeared to be over But an advertising campaign by the French company Perrier in 1974 was to bring about a dramatic change The Financial Times in an article on the Mineral and Spring waters market called the campaign a waste of time because bottled waters it said would be drunk only by cranks and foreigners How wrong they were Bottled water has become an extraordinary success story Sales of bottled water totalled 3 million litres in 1976 In just one decade that figure rose to 128 million litres and by 1991 some 300 million bottles of mineral water were drunk in Britain alone Wenche Marshall Foster Chairman and Chief Executive of Perrier UK predicts that the market will rise to one billion litres a year by the turn of the century A survey of 250 people from London and the Midlands published in 1992 found that a quarter of them never drank water directly from the tap Perrier has been joined by many other companies eager to cash in on the trend There are now 113 producers of bottled water in Britain from large hi tech bottling factories to small unsophisticated ones in garden sheds All are attempting to cash in on the 1 million a day UK market But the market is still dominated by the big names and supermarkets own brands Perrier owns Buxton Water Contrex Volvic Vichy Saint Yorre and others Scotland s Highland Spring which is owned by a consortium registered in Liechtenstein bottles for Tesco Sainsbury s and the Co op The image Whatever the brand name the image they project is the same cleanliness purity and health To sell a commodity at a high price to people who can get it for next to nothing out of the tap the image is all important and not always realistic Buxton Water is advertised on television and the bottle with pictures of the beautiful Derbyshire landscape The water is bottled in an industrial estate next to a busy railway yard Glyndwr Spring Water on the other hand is bottled by hand in a portacabin in a field Where they are bottled does not mean that they are necessarily contaminated but neither does it mean that they are necessarily safe to drink What is important is what is happening on the catchment area from which the water is taken Water is water What gives the different bottled waters their particular characteristics is the minerals and chemicals that they pick up in their passage through the ground and they will pick up any and all Most of the water is taken from a rural environment This means that to be safe to drink what happens on the earth through which they flow must be strictly controlled For example cattle and other animals excrete waste material Ground around springs should not be used for grazing Over large areas there should be no pesticides or herbicides used Do these areas get the degree of control they need Nobody knows there is no information Although all bottled waters are believed to be from natural springs some are not Some are from the same surface water sources as the local tap water and some are tap water Marwin UK Ltd based in a Manchester industrial estate markets a bottled water called Purefect 95 This comes straight out of a tap from the Manchester main water supply and is then purified further by the company Purefect 95 is not spring water but it is probably one of the cleanest and purest bottled waters on the market because the company s purification is in addition to all the checks cleaning and treating that the regulations demand of its public supply source Purefect 95 s label proclaims Purefect 95 is produced here in Manchester from upland water sources utilising the latest treatment techniques It is purified by a series of specialised processes which remove unwanted or potentially harmful chemicals giving you a wholesome water for all your drinking and culinary requirements With no minerals no organic or inorganic chemicals and no bacteria in it Marwin can claim with justification that it is the best bottled water you can buy Purefect 95 is not the only bottled tap water In the South Crystal Spring is bottled from London s tap water and the soft drinks giant Schweppes is planning to bottle tap water in Britain just as Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola already do in the USA The BBC1 consumer programme Watchdog looked at Designer Waters on 27 September 1996 The programme concentrated on Crystal Spring which is made in the basement of a London restaurant and which sells for 2 a bottle in around two hundred other restaurants They found that the only differences between Crystal Spring and the London tap water from which it is made were slightly raised levels of copper and zinc and because the chlorine had been removed bacteria levels 10 000 times higher Crystal Spring may still be safe to drink despite these high levels but it cannot be as safe as the original tap water A great book that shatters so many of the nutritional fantasies and fads of the last twenty years Read it and prolong your life

the most famous of Levi Strauss s inventions followed closely by jeans shorts and jeans jackets blue jeans have been an American staple for over 140 years Originally developed as work clothes for miners and cowboys jeans have since gone from durable mess clothes to a trendy fashion statement While a pair of Lev s today will run you about 60 there are many other jeans companies that are much less focused on value and much more focused on making a statement The following are just a few of the most expensive jeans known to man For All Mankind AVERAGE PRICE 150 300 Coming in appropriately at number 7 7 For All Mankind jeans are impressively expensive pants A fashion symbol for young kids with money to burn a pair of these jeans will run anywhere from 150 to 300 per pair Although 7 is a status brand that doesn t need to offer things like sales or reasonably priced goods they do offer free shipping on all orders over 150 This is incredibly nice of them considering denim only costs 5 per yard Picking up the tab on shipping cuts significantly into their 700 mark up but that s okay they are a brand for all mankind so they are glad to do it Roberto Cavalli AVERAGE PRICE 700 1 200 One of the newer brands rocking the American classic is from Italy Roberto Cavalli has caught the attention of J Lo as well as numerous other Hollywood fashionistas so you know they re pricey Ranging from 700 and 1200 Roberto Cavalli jeans have such luxury features as belt loops and 5 pockets seriously they are bragging about these things Other features not mentioned on the website but are included with every purchase include the fact that they are blue they are pants and people can wear them Made from the exotic cotton plant these denim bottoms will make you look like you re the tops Gucci AVERAGE PRICE 600 3 100 Though most normal Gucci jeans retail for a somewhat reasonable 600 there was one pair made in 1998 that sold for 3 100 The Gucci Genius Jeans named after the people who refused to buy them featured a hand stitched floral pattern that looks like a combination between a pair of clown pants and a child s quilt By adorning a pair of already overpriced jeans with incredibly over priced flower pieces Gucci was able to make an already ridiculous item even more ridiculous Though these jeans are not available over the counter there are many individuals who will sew whatever you want onto your jeans for a nominal fee APO AVERAGE PRICE 1 000 4 000 APO has one goal in mind to make a custom fit jeans tailored to you and only you Can anyone really put a price on such luxury Yes APO can That price is between 1 and 4 thousand dollars per pair The main difference in price appears to be caused by the type of rivets and buttons available Custom shoppers will have to make a choice between 14k gold platinum or diamond hardware to accompany their navy blue loin cloths While it may seem ridiculous to put such lavish jewelry on pants the reality is this more people check out your butt than your neck or wrist so you might as well accent it with some bling Key Closet AVERAGE PRICE 10 000 If Lady Gaga is into them you know they must be good good being Latin for stupidly expensive Although it is mind boggling to think that there are people in this world who would spend more money on pants than most people do on cars Key Closet makes that improbability a reality Featuring the always classy combination of a tiger and a dragon Key Closet offers a pair of diamond and Swarovski crystal studded pants for men You know men The same individuals who dug holes and blew up mountains wearing jeans a century ago The same individuals who are rolling in their graves at the thought of the things they were mining being permanently fixed to the crappy pants they wore while mining for them Yeah those guys They have diamond pants now Dussault AVERAGE PRICE 250 000 When the family jewels are used to cover the family jewels the resulting product is overwhelmingly expensive How expensive Dussault Apparel Ss line of Trashed Denim jeans will run you a cool 250 000 Made from 249 990 worth of gold diamonds and 10 worth of thrift store jeans the Trashed Denim line makes Sthe homeless look incredibly glamorous Looking faded stressed dirty and old these jeans rely on their bling value to make them worth anything more than 2 at a garage sale Although wearing them could be a powerful status statement you may be better off melting them down pawning the diamonds and using what s left as a car towel Secret Circus AVERAGE PRICE 1 3 Million Perhaps the most unassuming of the expensive jeans this pair of denim bottoms features a simple and elegant diamond studded patch on the rear right pocket The price tag 1 3 million dollars Due to the size color and clarity of the diamonds that elegant patch is actually a ridiculous display of perfection The question remains what better way to display the 15 most brilliant diamonds ever mined than on the ass of a woman s pair of pants Although this looks radiant sitting in these jeans can actually be quite painful Conclusion Although the jeans continues to become more and more expensive the basic design hasn t changed in over a century Still the workhorse of the American wardrobe blue jeans are everyone s favorite clothing item which may explain why some people are so anxious to adorn it with jewelry Whether you are a member of Hollywood s A list or just a regular shmoe who likes feeling comfortable nothing beats a good pair of jeans baur 0,00 euro versand + gratis geschenk bei erstem einkauf! der

a challenge We need to continually push ourselves outside our comfort zone to grow and stay sharp It is easy to become lazy and complacent However our brain and our body are a use it or lose it proposition Don t waste your potential We need to find ways to challenge ourselves with new activities and learning opportunities to live life to the fullest If you have something that makes you uneasy then face it head on Push yourself outside your comfort zone and you will beat all your fears Don t grow old gracefully Fight it every step of the way by seeking new ways to stretch yourself Here are some ideas to help get you started 1 Travel to a foreign country Take out a map and find a place you ve never been Plan a trip to a country that is unfamiliar to you It will stimulate your mind and your senses You will have the opportunity to pick up parts of a new language eat different foods and meet interesting people 2 Participate in a yoga class Yoga will stretch you very literally There are numerous benefits to yoga It will help you mentally physically and some say even spiritually It certainly will help you to relieve stress and become more physically fit If you are looking for ways to keep your body toned then a yoga class may be a good choice 3 Go on a solo backpacking trip There is something very stimulating about camping alone in the woods You are totally dependent on your own wits and skill A trip like this pits you against nature for comfort and sometimes survival The solitude will also give you time alone with your thoughts 4 Arrange a public speaking engagement Apparently speaking in public is a fear greater than death for some people This is one fear that everyone can conquer Why let something simple shackle you The key is to just do it Your local Toastmasters club would be happy to help 5 Audition for a role in a play Give your creative side a chance to come alive in the theater Were you in a high school production Why not give it a try again You might rediscover something about yourself that has been suppressed 6 Read a book with an opposing view We can all get set in our ways and our limited view of the world Pick up a book at your local library that purports a view that is contrary to one that you hold dear Read it from cover to cover and try to keep an open mind Note points that make some sense and ponder them 7 Change jobs I run into people all the time that seem to hate their jobs but they won t go out and find a better one Don t stay stuck in a rut any longer Take a step today toward finding a new position After all if you aren t happy now what do you have to lose 8 Volunteer to improve your community Volunteer opportunities abound These needs give us the chance to expose ourselves to things we won t normally see in our safe little lives It will expand our horizons and give us a greater appreciation for what we have In addition you might just make a difference in someone else s life along the way 9 Learn to scuba dive Find your local PADI certified training center and learn to be an Open Water Diver I was fortunate enough to do this myself recently It is a lot of fun and a bit of a challenge You will feel like a true explorer once you are certified 10 Dress up for Halloween Get yourself a costume and find yourself a Halloween party Express your inner child by dressing up and having some fun My wife and I did this last year and it was a complete hoot I highly recommend it as a way to bring yourself out of a shell 11 Take a dance class Dancing is great exercise a fun way to meet people and a fantastic way to creatively express yourself There are all kinds of dance classes that you can find to meet your individual tastes You might even meet a new friend in the process 12 Enroll in a college course Is it time to expand your knowledge in a particular area Maybe you need a way to spark new interest in a subject that has always intrigued you College courses are a great way to give yourself a new challenge while also expanding your opportunities 13 Introduce yourself to a complete stranger For some this is no big deal but for others of us this is not something that comes easily Set a goal to meet five new people this week What s the worst that can happen You might make a connection that will blossom into a fruitful relationship 14 Attend a service at the church of your choice Are you attending to your spiritual needs If not maybe it is time for you to seek out a place of worship Not sure where to go I would suggest asking a friend if you can accompany them It will make their day 15 Sit alone in complete silence for an hour This one sounds simple enough but give it a try It is harder than you think We are so accustomed to noise and to being in the presence of others that you might initially find this very challenging My guess is that if you do it for a few days that it will become something you love 16 Move to a new home Find a new place to live in a different city or at least on the other side of town A move will force you out of your ruts You will have to develop new routines and explore a new area This will give you a chance to grow and expand your boundaries 17 Go on an eco adventure Travel to Belize Costa Rica or another location that offers eco adventures The world is a big place and nature is full of fascinating creatures Get out there and see something new A trip like this is dangerous because it could change your entire life 18 Fly down a zip line Taking a zip line tour is a rush It will definitely get your adrenaline flowing I did this when I went to Puerto Vallarta Mexico earlier this year The zip line was total fun This type of thrill seeking awakens your adventurous spirit 19 Organize a reunion Reach out to some people that you haven t seen in awhile This could be family classmates or just an old friend that you haven t talked to in years Reminiscing about the past might stir up old ideas in you that you forgot you had 20 Write something and get it published Writing is a terrific way to express yourself and tap into your creativity Getting what you write published will give you a sense of accomplishment You will also probably get quite a nice boost from the positive reviews that you ll receive There is no excuse for remaining in your present rut A new challenge will energize you and give you the courage to continue to grow We only have one life to live and you do not want to waste another day Go stretch yourself outside your comfort zone What other ways are there to get out of our comfort zones Photo by stephcarter Related

the Royal Society of Chemistry wanted to find the perfect gravy recipe as part of their 2009 Year of Food project they went to Yorkshireman and chemist John Emsley He uses all the elements of a traditional roast to make his gravy from the meat juices to the water the vegetables are boiled in which add nutrients as well as flavour The perfect way to do the Sunday meal is with gravy from the joint Why waste the nutrients he says Start by cooking the joint on a bed of halved onions carrots and celery which juices from the meat will slowly trickle on to When the meat is cooked remove it from the roasting tin along with the vegetables Sprinkle a small amount of plain flour over the meat juices and fat Stir to form a dough or roux by gradually adding the water you ve boiled your accompanying vegetables in John says it works best with cabbage water If you boil things like cabbage you lose nutrients into the water Using that water in the gravy adds an extra little depth it s a way of putting that back into the meal Stir the gravy until all the meat juices and Marmite like deposits on the bottom of the roasting dish have dissolved Add iodised salt to taste and a teaspoon of soy sauce Perhaps a surprising addition soy sauce is a crucial ingredient because it reaches our fifth taste what the Japanese call umami Simmer to reduce the liquid to the right consistency stirring occasionally and then pour all over your traditional roast Souffl Penny Lewis who runs cookery courses at The Culinary Cottage near Abergavenny South Wales which deal with supposedly tricky dishes is confident that anyone can make a souffl that is lovely and light Most people are just frightened of it she says You do need a good whisk and a clean bowl Have it all in place before you start and the oven at the right temperature having the right equipment and ingredients to hand is important so you can time it right Preheat the oven to 200C Generously butter a 15cm souffl dish and coat with finely grated parmesan Separate four large eggs Melt 30g butter in a saucepan stir in 30g of plain flour half a teaspoon of mustard and a pinch of cayenne pepper Cook for a minute or two remove from the heat and stir in 225ml of full fat milk Return it to the heat whisking until thickened and continue to cook for a few minutes while continually whisking Remove from the heat Then stir in between 85g and 110g of either strong cheddar or gruy\u00e8re cheese followed by the egg yolks and salt and pepper Whisk the egg whites in a very clean bowl until they are stiff but not dry Gently fold in the cheese mixture with a metal spoon and pour into a souffl dish Run your thumb around the top edge of the dish for the top hat effect suggests Penny Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until it is golden brown and well risen To check if your souffl is ready open the oven door slightly but not before 20 minutes has elapsed and give the dish a gentle shove if it just wobbles it s ready if it is very wobbly allow five more minutes But the real key to souffl success is to eat it quickly Penny s final rule Make sure your guests are at the table and ready to eat when you get your souffl out of the oven Basmati rice Rice is one of those basic accompaniments that we should all be able to manage yet it so often ends up sticky We turned to Michelin starred chef Alfred Prasad from Indian restaurant Tamarind for his approach It s very easy he says This method applies to all good quality rice First measure your rice in a liquid measurement say 500ml Alfred insists that soaking the rice a process we might be tempted to skip is really important Grains of rice rub against each in the packet which produces a starchy powder and soaking gets rid of that he says After 10 to 15 minutes drain and then rinse the rice two or three times until it is no longer milky Measure your water using double the quantity of rice one litre of water for 500ml of rice Use a vessel at least twice its volume and put the water on to boil As soon as the water is boiling turn down the heat and throw in the soaked rinsed rice People do use salt but it s really not required says Alfred Another useful tip which probably won t go down well with the healthy eating brigade is to add a teaspoon of vegetable oil to keep the rice from sticking Stir the rice a couple of times to stop it from clumping at the bottom Alfred recommends using a spatula rather than a spoon and bring it back to the boil Once you get to the point when there is no more moisture on the top of the rice but while it is still fairly wet at the bottom turn the heat off he says Alfred then leaves the pan open without a lid so that all the excess steam can clear Leave for 10 minutes then transfer to your serving dish Meringues We all dream of fluffy cloud like creations with outer crunch and inner goo but may find ourselves brought back down to earth with browned flattened lumps Lynn Bolton has mastered the art and has up a mail order meringue company Head in the Clouds dedicated to selling her confections She shares her secrets for the classic meringue nest Ensure you have clean bowls and equipment any grease will deflate the meringue she says My Nan taught me to wipe out the bowls and the equipment with vinegar Pre heat the oven to 130C You need 200g of egg whites at room temperature and 400g of good quality white caster sugar If your eggs weigh in at 195g or 210g don t worry just double this weight for the sugar content says Lynn Meringues are pure chemistry sugar and egg white in a ratio of 2 to 1 Weigh the egg white as well as the sugar you can t go wrong Put the egg whites and sugar in a heat proof bowl stir to remove any lumps and place over a saucepan of just boiling water Make sure the bottom of the basin does not touch the water Leave over the water for around eight to 10 minutes stirring occasionally and checking that the sugar has melted Transfer to a mixing bowl to whisk Set a timer for 10 minutes Using an electric whisk beat for five minutes and then add seeds scraped from one vanilla pod and a few drops of vanilla essence Continue beating and feel the bowl as you go it will cool as the air is beaten into the mixture After eight minutes take the beaters out of the meringue and see if it holds its shape If it isn t stiff then beat for a further two minutes and test again before using the mixture Don t over beat the meringue it should be glossy like a gloss paint and not dull says Lynn Transfer the meringue mix on to a large lined baking tray Quickly work the meringue mixture into a round Approximately 200mm circumference so it is still nice and deep says Lynn and make a shallow well in the middle Put into the preheated oven and then immediately turn the temperature down to 110C Cook for three hours Check that the meringue is firm on the base by gently easing it off the tray and tapping it If at any point you think the meringue is going to give stop and cook for a further 30 minutes Once you are happy that it sounds dull this means it is still gooey inside and the base is firm turn the oven off Pastry Some of us might reach for the ready made stuff out of the supermarket freezer section but Gerhard Jenne of London based bakers Konditor Cook insists that making sweet pastry is literally as easy as one two three The recipe we use is very basic it s the 1 2 3 method one part sugar two parts butter and three parts flour You don t even need scales If you want to make it a bit finer you could also add an egg yolk says Gerhard The most important thing is the sugar itself he says Never use granulated sugar it s too coarse and can taste a bit gritty When you bake it the grains go splodgy He recommends using good caster sugar or for a really fine pastry icing sugar Pastry is never going to be a health food and Gerhard refuses to skimp on the salt suggesting that you should add it or use salted butter to bring out the flavour If you re using egg yolk start with the sugar and yolk add the grease and then the flour You can mix it by hand which Gerhard insists is quite easy to do although they use a food processor It comes together fairly quickly but once it is together you don t want to overwork it do it fairly speedily says Gerhard Once you ve got a nice dough don t mess about wrap it in clingfilm and pop it in the fridge to chill for half an hour Once you ve taken it out of the fridge knead it or work it over a couple of times it won t need much pastry is pretty pliable Then roll it out with as little flour as possible You don t want a residue it won t look very nice he adds A common problem with pastry that often it is not cooked properly Gerhard recommends quite a hot oven of between 180C and 200C depending on the size of your dish Cook it until it is golden there s nothing worse than undercooked pale pastry it s a bit insipid White sauce A white sauce or bchamel to give it its more intimidating name is the classic base for many a sauce Top chef Paul Gayler whose book Sauce is dedicated to the art of making a great sauce tells us how to get it lump free Start by halving a small onion and stud each half with two cloves Place in a pan with 600ml of full fat milk and a small bay leaf The onion cloves and bay leaf infuse the milk making it aromatic says Paul Bring the milk to the boil and simmer gently for four to five minutes In another pan make a roux Begin by melting 45g of butter and add 45g of plain flour Cook for 30 to 40 seconds stirring frequently until the roux is pale yellow Make sure you have equal amounts of butter and flour so you get a nice smoothness If you have too much flour it ll be sandy and never cook out Put the milk through a fine strainer then beat it vigorously into the roux and stir until the sauce is smooth Using a wooden spoon to stir it gives it a lovely silky appearance and you can slap the sauce up against the sides says Paul Slowly bring the bchamel to the boil reduce the heat and then simmer it for 20 minutes beating occasionally until the sauce is smooth and glossy Cook it nice and slowly You need to simmer it to allow the flour to cook out Stick it in the

fireplace so smores are a treat that I do not get to enjoy often enough They are such a winning flavor combination ooey gooey creamy marshmallows crunchy graham crackers and of course the delicious melty chocolate So if this girl wants smores she has to improvise a bit and whip them up in the oven I think I have found one heck of a great way to do just that Smores Pops Here s what you need for your indoor smores pops Pretty simple graham crackers marshmallows and chocolate You can also use graham cracker crumbs or sprinkles if you like There is really no scientific formula and you could use miniature marshmallows big marshmallows homemade marshmallows heck you can even use marshmallow fluff Have fun and use what you have Prepare your work area with some wax paper Because I was using full size marshmallows I decided to cut them in half You could do this with a knife kitchen shears a pizza cutter or you could probably even just tear them apart I went with the pizza cutter route A bit sticky but it got the job done After cutting your marshmallows you will want to sit them on your graham crackers I used one large marshmallow per smore You could use more it s really up to your personal taste You can heat your marshmallows two different ways microwave or oven While I love the roasted tops of the marshmallows from the oven honestly for the smore pops I think the microwave works better It makes the marshmallows sticky enough on both sides so that they bind to the graham crackers nicely If you use the microwave it only takes a few seconds literally The marshmallows above were in the microwave less than five seconds Those babies puff up FAST If you put the marshmallows in the oven as shown above without the top graham cracker on them you will have to work a bit more to get the top graham cracker to stay in place I achieved this by smooshing the gooey marshmallow around the sides Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do I m thinking that if you put the top marshmallow on before putting it in the oven the grahams will stay put though you will lose a bit of the crunchy cooked marshmallow taste I baked this tray of marshmallows for about 2 3 minutes at 425 degrees After they come out of the oven or microwave you will want to get the top graham crackers onto the marshmallows quickly You will have some ooze out the sides but that s okay The entire thing is going to be covered in chocolate so neatness really isn t a concern After putting the tops on you can slip your sticks into the marshmallows You can skip this part if you don t want to go the pop route After putting the graham cracker tops on and inserting the sticks you will want to let these set up for a bit An hour is enough time you just want the marshmallows to firm back up a bit Once the marshmallows are set up you can melt your chocolate Follow the directions on your package of chocolate You will want to make sure the melted chocolate cools a little bit before dipping otherwise you ll have a gooey mess But a delicious one I don t actually dip mine as I never have that much chocolate I use a small bowl and do a combo of dipping in chocolate and spooning on the chocolate Make sure to tap tap tap to get the excess drippy chocolate off Not that excess chocolate is ever a bad thing but it can be quite a mess After dipping in chocolate you can sprinkle the tops with graham cracker crumbs graham cracker chunks chocolate chips sprinkles or whatever else your little heart desires I sit mine on wax paper and let the chocolate set for an hour or so The time for the chocolate to set will vary based on the chocolate you use how hot it is the weather and possibly your astrological sign Okay maybe not that last one After that you are ready to ENJOY These are crazy good plain and simple Yum Smores on a stick Smores pops One thing that could make these even more outrageous would be to add in chocolate to the center of the smore I m going to have to give that a try next time I make them Without a stick Still JUST as tasty When I leave out the stick I do not completely cover them in chocolate Mainly because I don t want to get my hands all covered in chocolate I have a weird OCD issue with that I m a big fan of nice clean hands but that s another story And if you have the willpower to not devour them all in one sitting and can manage to give some away simply adding a cellophane bag and some ribbon will create a cute gift or favor Quick delicious and no campfire required However If you prefer you can sit around and sing kum ba yah and pretend you have that campfire part I m pretty much satisfied with the chocolate part though graham crackers and marshmallows are covered in chocolate and served on a stick for these easy and delicious smores pops. smores, smores
